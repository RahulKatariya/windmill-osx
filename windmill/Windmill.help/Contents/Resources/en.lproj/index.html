			<h2 class="Name">Welcome to Windmill - #PoweredByWindmill</h2>
			<p>Make sure Windmill is running alongside Xcode on your development Mac.</p>
			<p>If you work in a team of developers, each of you should be running an instance of Windmill.</p>			
			<p>Windmill aims to automate in a reliable and predictable way a lot of the work so that you can focus on delivering your app.</p>
			<p>It is about eliminating risk that comes from doing things manually, hasty as well as catching errors and dealing with failures as soon as possible.</p>			
			<p>Windmill provides a tight integration with Xcode and is designed with iOS development in mind. It knows about your project's schemes, settings, can run your app on the Simulator, prepare the archive bundle, export the IPA and more.</p>
			<p>Windmill also aims to provide a consistent view with Xcode. Thus any error messages, test failures and logs mirror that of Xcode. That way when your project fails in Windmill, it will fail in the same way as Xcode.</p>
