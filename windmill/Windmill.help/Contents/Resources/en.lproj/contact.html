		My name is Markos Charatzas also known as <a href="https://qnoid.com">qnoid</a>. I am the human that conceived, designed, implemented, funded and brought to life Windmill. I have been a software engineer since 2003, first in Java for the enterprise followed by iOS in 2009 and macOS since Windmill. The first git commit was on Tue Jun 24 20:36:36 2014. 
</p>
	<p>
		Around mid 2017 I made the decision to give Windmill a fair chance by commiting to it full time. I quit my job; gave away, donated, sold most of my belongings and left London in September 2017. I currently reside in Athens, Greece. On February 14th 2018, Windmill 1.0 was released. Windmillâ€™s goal is to provide overall support while developing an iOS app to be released to the App Store.
</p>
	<p>
		I have and still do put in *a lot* of time, money and effort into Windmill. On a personal level, Windmill allows me to have freedom of expression, be creative and pursue excellence.
</p>
	<p>
		I do believe Windmill adds tremendous value and is a positive change to this world. What you see in Windmill 2.x today is and will remain free. Having said that, I do have to pay the rent and personal savings can and will only take me so far. The plan is to have a subscription tier for cases that make "business sense" and have a cost to run.
</p>
	<p>
		At this time there is no dedicated technical support. In any case, I have built Windmill for you, so if you can not use it or it is a source of frustration I would like to know about it so that I can improve it.

		You can reach out on Twitter at <b>@windmill_io</b>.
</p>
	<p>
		You can also reach me at <b>qnoid@windmill.io</b> to share your thoughts and experience while using Windmill. I am really interested in any feedback you have especially if it has changed the way in which you develop, iterate and deliver your app.
</p>
	<p>
		I sincerely hope that Windmill improves your life as an iOS Developer by a little bit.
