		As soon as you have an active subscription, Windmill on the Mac will start to distribute your application.
	</p>
	<p>
		Every time a new commit to your project repository is made, Windmill will distribute a new build for your application. Windmill will only distribute a new build for your application upon a succesful run. This is to ensure that you never end up with a broken version.
	</p>
	<b>Tip:</b> Should the distribution of a build fail (e.g. due to a network error):

	<ol>
		<li>Hover over the lights under the distribute stage</li>
		<li>Poke the lights once the pointing-hand cursor appears</li>
	</ol>

	<img alt="" width="104" height="56" src="img/distribution/distribute_retry.png" />

	<p>
	Windmill will try to distribute the build again.
